DeviceSync for iOS
==================

On OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), calendar synchronization between iOS and OS X no longer works with USB.

If you do not want to use iCloud for synchronization, this litte app may provide a workaround.

Install
-------

Download 'DeviceSync for OS X' as zip file from [github release page](https://github.com/yep/DeviceSync-for-OS-X/releases).

Download 'DeviceSync for iOS' from the [iOS AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/devicesync-for-ios/id737867459?mt=8)

Usage
-----

 * Connect your iOS and OS X device to each other by USB
 * Start [DeviceSync for OS X](https://github.com/yep/DeviceSync-for-OS-X) on OS X
 * Start [DeviceSync for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/devicesync-for-ios/id737867459?mt=8) on iOS
 * Press 'Sync' button in 'DeviceSync for iOS' to start synchronization

WARNING
-------

Synchronization is currently one way: from iOS to OS X.

ALL DATA ON YOUR OS X DEVICE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!

No warranty for data loss.

Be sure to add and update your calendar entries and contacts on iOS only.

Roadmap
-------

As time permits, I will improve merging behavior of calendar entries and contacts.

For feature requests, please add an issue at github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yep/DeviceSync-for-iOS/issues).

Even better, support open source software and add a bounty to your github issue at [bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/). Small and symbolical donations are welcome as well.

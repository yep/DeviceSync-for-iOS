iosCalSync
==========

On OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), calendar synchronization between iOS and OS X no longer works with USB.

If you do not want to use iCloud for synchronization, this litte app may help.

Usage
-----

 * Connect your iOS and OS X device to each other by USB
 * Start [osxCalendarSync](https://github.com/yep/osxCalSync) on OS X
 * Start [iosCalendarSync](https://github.com/yep/iosCalSync) on iOS
 * Press 'sync' in iosCalendarSync to start synchronization

WARNING
-------

Synchronization is one way: from iOS to OS X.

ALL CALENDAR DATA ON YOUR OS X DEVICE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!

Be sure to add and update your calendar entries on iOS only.
